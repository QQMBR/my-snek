    <string name="intro_text">A simple game of snake with a few settings you can twiddle around with.
        The game was implemented with RxJava2 handling the game logic and OpenGL ES 2.0 to display
        the game\'s state. The game\'s design, especially for the colors, orients itself on
        Google\'s Material Design guidelines, for example for legibility and button design.
        The app also uses many Android Jetpack components such as Navigation for a
        single Activity design, ViewModel and LiveData to preserve state upon a device configuration
        change (such as a rotation) as well as Preferences for, wellâ€¦ Preferences.

        P.S. If you find any bugs, crashes, etc., don\'t be surprised! :P
